This C# program is designed to create a short two-word sentence at random. It uses enums to define the subject and verb, generates a random
number no larger than the amount of enums in its given context, and selects a random word from that enum list. Then it's a simple matter
of writing both random words to the console interface.

This is the first stage in an ongoing personal project with the goal of creating more complicated (but coherent) sentences using this same
random generation. The ultimate goal is to be able and create entire paragraphs complete with names and more complex topics. Eventually, I
would like to write entire pages or even a book using this process.
